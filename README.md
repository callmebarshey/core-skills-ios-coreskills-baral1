Open file with `xcworkspace`file rather than `xccodeproj` file, otherwise pods will not load correctly.

Cocoapods for this project require version 1.10.1 as of 3/14/2021. You may need to update pods periodically throughout the project if Firebase is updated by Google.

After Cloning this project. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory.
